#+title: Swidden: Amazon Search Result Parser

A work-in-progress utility for parsing Amazon search results. I am incrementally targeting different kinds of search results and adding more functionality. Note that this project, while offering naive scraping via the [[https://github.com/clj-commons/etaoin][Etaoin Clojure Webdriver protocol implementation]], is primarily focused on the parsing of page HTML. As time progresses I will expose a clean interface so that the parsing functionality can be easily accessed by a scraping solution.

Here is what the parser can currently handle as well as /some/ of the planned features:

- ☒ Result titles
- ☒ Result authors
- ☐ Author URLs
- ☒ Check if result is sponsored
- ☒ Return product URL
- ☒ First book format listing
- ☐ Handle multiple book format listings
- ☒ Actual price
- ☐ List price
- ☐ Alternative offers
- ☐ Image extraction
- ☐ Stars
- ☐ Review count
- ☐ Delivery details
